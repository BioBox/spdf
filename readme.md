**spdf** is the [suckless][suckless] pdf viewer.

Well, _kind of_. I'm currently not affiliated with the association. More
importantly, this is in C++. However given what's currently available this is
the closest thing to one that you'll ever find.

## Building

Dependencies are Xlib and poppler.

## Special Thanks

This project is a fork of [lpdf][lpdf]. I wouldn't recommend using it though as
it uses poppler's internal unstable api for some reason.
